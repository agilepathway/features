name: "CI - Test Features on ARM64"
# The M1 or M2 chips on Apple Macs are ARM64.
# GitHub Actions do not have a Linux ARM64 runner yet (see https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/5631)
# So as a workaround we use BuildJet (https://buildjet.com/for-github-actions) to test on Linux ARM64 images
# (i.e. mimicking the common setup of using a Linux devcontainer on a Mac host computer).
# We only trigger these tests manually (i.e. on workflow_dispatch), when we have made a change that we want to
# test, or when we want to do an occasional regression test, because otherwise we would quickly use up the
# BuildJet free trial minutes.
