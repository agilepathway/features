## OS Support

This Feature should work on recent `x86_64`/`amd64` or `aarch64`/`arm64` versions of Debian/Ubuntu-based distributions with the `apt` package manager installed.

If `aarch64`/`arm64` then the Feature will install node and npm if they are not already on the devcontainer (as they are needed
for `aarch64`/`arm64` Prism installs).

`bash` is required to execute the `install.sh` script.
